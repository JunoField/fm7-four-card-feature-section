- Grid and flexbox
- [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/) - CSS extension framework
- [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/) - Provides testing server, build tools, etc.


### Continued development

The shadows around the boxes are not 100% correct - this will need improvement in future projects, as it is a very common feature of modern sites.
